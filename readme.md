##odin project recipes##
This project is to demonstrate beginning 'boilerplate' to 'brutalist' webpage design with a simple collection of cooking recipes and the like.
Beyond that to demonstrate basic use of html as a reflection point.

Reflecting: I used the basics of html to demonstrate my ability to construct a sheer brutalist recipe site using the odin-project. Putting together recipes is useful and it will be interesting to create more interactive sites from this project.
